# Micro-Frontend React Platform (Abstracted)

## Problem
Teams were blocked by a monolithic frontend build and shared release cycles.

## Solution
- Federated micro-frontends
- Shared design system
- Shell-based module orchestration
- CI-enforced contracts

## Impact
- ~25% reduction in build times
- Faster independent feature shipping
- Clearer ownership boundaries
